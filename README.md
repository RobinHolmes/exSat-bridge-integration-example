# exSat Bridge Integration Example

This repository contains example code and documentation for integrating with the exSat Bridge. To enhance the flexibility of bridging BTC assets to the exSat network for third-party applications.

## Overview

The exSat Bridge acts as an intermediary layer between your application and the exSat Network, handling the complexities of satellite communication protocols and data formatting. This integration example demonstrates how to request a Bitcoin deposit address from the bridge contract and query the corresponding BTC deposit address via EVM address.

## Example Implementations

We provide implementation examples in several programming languages to help you get started quickly:

- [TypeScript/Node.js Implementation](./typescript/README.md)
- [Go Implementation](./golang/README.md)

Each language-specific directory contains its own detailed documentation, code samples, and setup instructions.

## Requirements

- A whitelist eos account for exSat Bridge application (obtain from the exSat developer portal)
- Network access to exSat Bridge endpoints
- Supported language runtime (see specific implementation requirements)

## Getting Started

1. Choose your preferred language implementation from the options above
2. Follow the language-specific setup instructions
3. Configure your EOS account and private key
4. Run the example application to test connectivity
